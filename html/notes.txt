2 types of HTML elements:
- Non-replaced: usually have closing tags and dictate how the content between the tags should be marked up
- Replaced and void: usually without a closing tag, the element becomes something else (e.g. image, form UI element,
  etc.)

The function of HTML elements is to describe what the content is - not to style it.

Essentials for every HTML page:
- Type of document
- Human language
- Character set
- Title

Always add <!DOCTYPE html> as a first line - tells the browser to use standards mode (not quirks mode)
Skeleton:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
    <head>
    </head>
    <body>
    </body>
</html>

The head section contains all the metadata for a site. ALWAYS include:
- character set
- title
- viewport settings

Always use UTF-8 encoding (it's the standard required for HTML5)
<meta charset="utf-8" />
- the '/' at the end of the tag is a classic way of indicating that the tag is has no closing tag

Should always use the viewport meta tag.
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />

Metadata that should be included outside of the <meta> tags:
- CSS
    - <link> with 'rel' attribute set to 'stylesheet' (preferred)
    - include the CSS directly within the head within opening and closing <style> tags
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
    - 'type="text/css"' is unnecessary! (unless using something other than css)
    - custom properties can be declared in the <head> <style> block:
    <style>
        :root {
            --theme-color: #226DAA;
        }
    </style>

While styles can go in the body, they're better in the head for performance.

- Favicon
    - the little icon appearing in the browser tab
    - when not declared, browser tries to find 'favicon.ico' in the top-level directory
    - <link> allows you to use a different file name and location:
<link rel="icon" sizes="16x16 32x32 48x48" type="image/png" href="/images/mlwicon.png" />
    - which means use icon specified in scenarios where 16/32/48px makes sense
    - size can be 'any' for scalable icons or a space-separated list of widthXheight values (must be multiples of 16, x
    or X)
    - extras for apple:
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="180x180" href="/images/mlwicon.png" />
<link rel="mask-icon" href="/images/mlwicon.svg" color="#226DAA" />
    - apple-touch-icon is for iOS devices when a site is added to the home screen
    - you can specify multiple icons with different sizes for different devices
    - mask-icon is used for pinned tabs on macOS Safari - icon should be monochrome SVG colored using 'color' attribute
    - be consistent in icon usage across a website

- Alternate versions
    - used to identify translations or alternate representations of the site
<link rel="alternate" href="https://www.machinelearningworkshop.com/fr/" hreflang="fr-FR" />
<link rel="alternate" href="https://www.machinelearningworkshop.com/pt/" hreflang="pt-BR" />
    - when using 'alternate' for a translation, the 'hreflang' attribute must be set
